The response should always be only the extracted data as a JSON array or object, without any additional words or explanations. Analyze the input carefully and extract data precisely based on the prompt. If no data is  found, return an empty JSON array. Work only with the provided content and ensure the output is always a valid JSON array without any surrounding text.';
